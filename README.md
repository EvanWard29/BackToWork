#### Product Vision:
This application is designed for any size family who is looking to be more organised around the house. The Mobile Family Planner is a Mobile Application that will allow families to add members of their family to a family group within the app. This will then allow them to set up and assign chores to each member of the family. The application also offers other features such as a calendar for planning events in a week and a reward system for completing chores.
