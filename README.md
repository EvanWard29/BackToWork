#### Product Vision:
My product vision for Back to Work is to build an interactive website that allows users to create household groups where they can assign chores to the different members of the group. Points can then be earned by users for completing chores which they can redeem for physical rewards. An interactive group calendar allows users to stay organised with events and keep track of chore deadlines for the group.
